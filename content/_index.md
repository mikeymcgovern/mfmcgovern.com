I am a [Resident Fellow](https://law.yale.edu/michael-mcgovern) at [Yale Law School](https://law.yale.edu/)'s [Information Society Project](https://law.yale.edu/isp). I study how science is used to construct _and_ contest ideas about human difference, and how such ideas become embedded in technology, law, and social policy.

Put broadly, I am interested in the history of _data_: the ways concepts, materials, and politics shape what counts in the social and natural world. My [current project](/research/) follows civil rights advocates' efforts to measure and prove racial discrimination in U.S. courts since the 1960s. By providing a historical account of the opportunities and hazards of quantitative frameworks for racial justice, I seek to inform discussions about discrimination in our era of big data and machine learning.

I recieved my PhD in History of Science from Princeton üêØ. I live in New Haven üçï, [sing](http://www.christchurchnh.org/music#the-christ-church-choir) early music üéµ, and once [modeled](https://archive.varsity.co.uk/780.pdf) bowties ‚ßì.

Here is my [latest CV](/pdf/McGovern_20230901_CV.pdf). You can reach me at michael \[dot] mcgovern \[at] yale \[dot] edu.
